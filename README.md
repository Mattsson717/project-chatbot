# Project Name

This week, Jessi Nygren Walhed and Patrik Mattsson developed a dog bot. That asks if you like dogs or if you are a cat person. If you like dogs you get to answer what breed you like, and if you are a cat person you get a goodbye message and the page restarts. The purpose of the project was to practice working with the DOM, functions, conditionals and variables.

## The problem

We think that we went a bit fast into coding, not structuring the plan from start. So a learning to next time is to approach it like that instead. :-)
